## About Me

A Research group specializing in Computer science at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China. Currently, we are focusing on the study and applications of vision (language)-to-language (vision). Some of the data and checkpoints are availabe at: https://huggingface.co/OpenFace-CQUPT。


## Research Interests

- **大型视觉-语言模型** 
- **多模态表示学习** 
- **生成式AI**
